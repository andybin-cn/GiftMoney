BUILD AND INSTALL
=================

* To build and install, for most environments:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

* To build a native Win32 library under cygwin, use this configure:

    CC='gcc -mno-cygwin' ./configure --host=mingw32 --build=mingw32 --with-iconv=no

* If you've cloned the git repository, instead of downloading a release,
  do this first:

    ./bootstrap 
    

MAINTENANCE
===========

* To build versions for multiple architectures from the same place:
- create a directory for each arch: arch-<arch-name>
- call configure and make from within each directory

* When you update configure.ac, or when there is an upgrade of autoconf/libtool
  versions, do this:

    ./bootstrap

  Then:

    ./configure

* To build a binary distribution, use the following commands after 
  substituting the current version number (e.g., 0.30) for <version> and
  the current computer architecture (e.g., i386)

DESTDIR="$PWD/libxls-<version>-<arch>" make install
tar cvzf libxls-<version>-<arch>.tar.gz libxls-<version>-<arch>
